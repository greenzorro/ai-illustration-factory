<Character-1>On the left side of the frame, a little boy with messy black hair and round cheeks wears a blue striped T-shirt, khaki shorts, and white sneakers. His body faces diagonally toward a flower bush, right arm fully extended upward with fingers slightly curled in mid-reach, left hand gripping his shorts pocket. His round eyes focus intensely on the yellow flower, lips parted in concentration. The child stands on tiptoe with knees slightly bent.</Character-1>  
<Character-2>On the right side, a middle-aged woman with shoulder-length black wavy hair wears a beige knitted sweater over light blue jeans and brown leather loafers. She leans forward with her left arm stretched across the frame, firmly grasping the boy's wrist with both hands. Her round face shows visible tension - eyebrows drawn together, mouth open mid-exclamation. Her body faces 3/4 toward the boy while her gaze locks onto his reaching hand.</Character-2>  
<Background>A sunny urban park with neatly trimmed green grass, clusters of blooming daisies and peonies, and scattered deciduous trees in mid-distance. Smooth concrete walking path visible behind the figures.</Background>
